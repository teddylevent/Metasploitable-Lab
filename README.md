# Metasploitable-Lab


## Objective


The Metasploitable Lab project aimed to set up a vulnerable system and a hacking machine to safely learn penetration techniques by using the metasploitable framework to identify a vulnerability and exploit it to gain access to the vulnerable machine in a legal and controlled environment.


### Skills Learned

- Installing metasploitable in a virtual machine
- Understanding how to scan ports using NMAP/Zenmap
- Understanding how to research vulnerabilities and exploit them from a hacker's perpective


### Tools Used


- Network Scanning tool (NMAP/ZENMAP)
- Virtual Machine (Kali Linux) (VMWARE)
- Metasploitable Framework
-
